A bunch of functions and fixes I use between my mods and likely will in the future.
So in order to save YOUR RAM and MY time I made this.

A mod required by a mod, mainly this one:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3139034529
and soon to be the blind one too likely once I update.

Just to be safe I'd load this early in load order, before any of my mods.
